# Lab 3 - Loops


## Question No.1
Develop a program that will output the line of text “I love Programming”, 10 times.  
Demonstrate how to do this using a for-loop, a while-loop and a do while loop.


## Question No.2
Develop a program that will output the seven times table. You must use a for loop, as follows:  
1 x 7 = 7  
2 x 7 = 14  
3 x 7 = 21 . . .


## Question No.3
Modify the above program so the user can choose which number they want to output a multiplication table for. 


## Question No.4
Modify the program so your app continuously asks the user to enter a number.  
The program then outputs the multiplication table for the specified number. The program exits when the person types any number less than 1 into the app.


## Question No.5
Calculating sums.  

**Part 1:**  
Develop a program that prompts the user to 5 numbers. Your program should output the sum of the 5 numbers;  

**Part 2:**
Modify your program to allow the user to enter as many numbers as they want. Your program should output the sum of all the numbers.  
When asking users for a number, you must use a do-while loop  

**Part 3:**
Repeat Part 2, but use a while loop when asking for input  

**Part 4:**
Modify the program in part 1 to output:
- The average of all numbers (sum of numbers / total numbers)
- The product of all numbers (multiply all numbers and output result )


## Question No.6
Develop a program that will prompt the user to 6 numbers and then print the number of positive numbers and the sum of negative numbers in the set.  
For example, if user enters:  10 50 -2 30 -10 99
The program should output:  
Number of +ve numbers: 4  
Sum of -ve numbers: -12


## Question No.7
Develop a program to read 6 numbers and find the average of all odd numbers.


## Question No.8
Develop a program that will prompt the user to enter 5 numbers and then print the smallest and largest number to the screen.


## Question No.9
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a start year and an end year. Your program must then print all the leap years between said range, **inclusive of the start and end year.**


## Question No.10
Develop a program that does the following:  

1. Prompts the user for their name and age. The user’s age must be between 10 - 16. If a user's age is invalid then you must display a suitable error message and force them to enter a valid age. Your program should do this **until** they enter a valid age, i.e, an age between 10-16.

1. **Once the user enters a valid age**, prompt the user for a **set** of numbers. Your program must find the **average** of the numbers entered and display it to the user.

1. Determine the largest and smallest number from the set of numbers entered and display them  to the screen.


## Question No.11
You have been hired as a programmer by the Ministry of Education  to develop a JavaScript program for Standard 5 students. The said program should test students’ knowledge on the types of triangles, classified with regards to the number of equal sides they have.  

The program that you are to develop MUST prompt the user for 3 Triangles (inclusive of their dimensions), then print the type of triangle each triangle conforms to (that is, Scalene, 
 Isosceles and Equilateral) and lastly print the number of times each triangle was entered.  

Note, for each triangle you must prompt the user to enter all of its dimensions i.e., side 1, side 2 and side 3. Also, a valid triangle must have sides greater than 0. Thus, if the user enters any side that is not greater than 0 then the triangle would be invalid and your program must state such.  

Please see below for details with regards to Triangles that are classified according to the number of equal sides they have:-

1. Equilateral triangle: An equilateral triangle is a triangle that has three equal sides, thus all sides are equal to each other. The following is an equilateral triangle.

1. Isosceles triangle: An isosceles triangle is a triangle that has two equal sides, thus any two sides are equal to each other. The following is an isosceles triangle.

1. Scalene triangle: A scalene triangle is a triangle that has no equal sides thus; all sides are not equal to each other. The following is a scalene triangle.

**SEE BELOW FOR EXAMPLE OF HOW YOUR PROGRAM MUST RUN:**  
Please enter the dimensions for triangle 1:  
Side 1: 10  
Side 2: 5  
Side 3: 10  
This triangle is an Isosceles triangle because two sides are equal to each other.  

Please enter the dimensions for triangle 2:  
Side 1: 20  
Side 2: 20  
Side 3: 20  
This triangle is an Equilateral because all the sides are equal to each other.  
	
Please enter the dimensions for triangle 3:  
Side 1: 15  
Side 2: 7  
Side 3: 5  
This triangle is a scalene because all the sides are not equal to each other.  

Please enter the dimensions for triangle 4:  
Side 1: 15  
Side 2: 6  
Side 3: 6  
This triangle is an Isosceles triangle because two sides are equal to each other.  

Please enter the dimensions for triangle 5:  
Side 1: -6  
Side 2: 7  
Side 3: 7  
This is not a valid triangle.  

The number of Isosceles triangles entered was: 2  
The number of Scalene triangles entered was: 1  
The number of Equilateral triangles entered was: 1
